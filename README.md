Cyber systems are essential for enhancing power system operation’s dependability and
efficiency as well as making sure the system stays within safe operating parameters. An
adversary can compromise the cyber layer’s enabled control and monitoring applications,
thereby causing significant harm to the physical system underneath.Distribution system
state estimation (DSSE) is a critical task for the reliable and efficient operation of power
distribution systems.The IEEE 33 bus distribution system is considered
for this study. Both static and dynamic state estimation are implemented using one of the
supervised machine learning models known as the decision tree model.One of major cyber attack known as DoS attack is discussed,a data driven estimation method for the attack
interval is analyzed.
